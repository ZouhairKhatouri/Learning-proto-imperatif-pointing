# Learning-proto-imperatif-pointing

Classes:
  - arm.py: a file containing the class Arm that models a bi-angular arm of a child.
  - caregiver.py a file containing the class CareGiver that models the caregiver.
  - eyeAndArm.py: a file containing the class EyeAndArm, suited form of Arm for pointing moving objects.

Scenarios:
  - main_test.py: a scenorio for comparison between three learning strategies: 1) Dirac kernel  2) Gaussian kernel 3) Gaussian kernel + scaffolding.
  - n_objs_effect_test.py: a scenario for the assesment of the effect of the number of objects on the learning speed.
  - objects_on_mvt_test.py: a scenario for the performance evaluation of the proposed model for the case of moving objects.
  - scaffolding_param_test.py: a scenario allowing to find the optimal parameters for the scaffolding.
